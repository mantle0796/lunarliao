## Getting Started

## Add LL contract address to wallet

Contract address : 0x30326b09e4295751C1cE46188345EE46eE7a3C36

[Verify LL on testnet](https://explorer.sepolia.mantle.xyz/token/0x30326b09e4295751C1cE46188345EE46eE7a3C36)


First, run the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
